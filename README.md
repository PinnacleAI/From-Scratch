# From-Scratch
<h3>Do you have what it takes to implement that module you love using from scratch? Give it a try and make sure you meet the below criteria</h3>


<ul>
    <li>Ensure that your own version implements at least 80% of the original version functionality</li>
    <li>Make your code as efficient as you can possibly make it, and learn as you watch others make it more efficient than you can!</li>
    <li>Do not use any functionality from the module you are trying to copy an implementation</li>
</ul>
